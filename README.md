Answer the questions 
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]] 
* Can this sequence be considered correct? 
* If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct? 

ANSWER:
No. It's incorrect.
We need to remove most right "]" and first "(" to make it correct.
Because there must be a closing parenthesis/bracket for every opening parenthesis/bracket.
It must look like that [(())()(())]
* There is also an option to add missing brackets. If we do this, the answer will look like this [[((())()(()))]]
